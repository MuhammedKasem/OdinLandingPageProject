# OdinLandingPageProject

This is my first project in The Odin Project!

The Task:

Create a website from scratch using HTML & CSS using the provided image as a template. We were allowed to use google and use what we practiced in our previous CSS excercises but we were not allowed to look at any completed solutions.

My Thoughts:

I personally felt as if the assignment provided a good enough challenge as to where you had to combine your own creative thinking alongside the knowledge that was provided within the previous assignments. i struggled a little bit at first creating the sub-header but after that everything was smooth sailing. We were also encouraged to go out and grab CSS styling bits from the web which I did in order to give my website a little more of its own personal flair.
